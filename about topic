Time series clustering is a data mining technique that organizes data points into groups based on their similarity in time. It's used to analyze and forecast phenomena such as weather, stock prices, and customer behavior.
Here are some clustering algorithms:
Hierarchical clustering
A popular and easy-to-understand algorithm that can cluster time series with unequal lengths. It has two types: 
Agglomerative hierarchical clustering: Starts with each item as a cluster and gradually merges them 
Divisive hierarchical clustering: Starts with all objects as a single cluster and splits it to reach clusters with one object 
K-means clustering
A basic and popular algorithm that clusters data into groups based on the distance between their centroids 
Feature-based clustering
Extracts relevant features from time series data, such as mean, variance, frequency, or autocorrelation 
The goal of time series clustering is to maximize data similarity within clusters and minimize it across clusters.
